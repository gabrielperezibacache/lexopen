## 2024-09-06 - [Layout Sequential DB Queries]
**Learning:** `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` was doing multiple sequential Prisma database calls (`notification.count`, `mailboxMessage.count`) on every single authenticated page load since it's the root app layout. This causes unnecessary round-trips to the DB.
**Action:** When a Next.js Layout needs multiple independent pieces of data, wrap the Prisma queries in `Promise.all` to fetch them concurrently. Since layouts wrap all child routes, optimizing layout data fetching provides a global performance benefit.
